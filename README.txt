Project: Student Management System

What is it? 

	Allows user to add x amount of new students to the database.
	User should be prompted for name and year for each student.
	Student will have a 5-digit unique ID, with the first number being grade level.
	Students May enroll in the following courses:
		1 - History 95
		2 - Math 20a
		3 - Physics 2a
		4 - Chemistry 6a
		5 - Computer Science 12
	
	Each course costs $100 to enroll.
	Students will be able to view their balance and pay the tuition.
	To see student status, we should see their name, ID, courses enrolled, and balance.

Will need to create a Student Class.
